00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.120
One day I will be the greatest trainer

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.120
How am I going to struggle

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.519
These creatures, I carry them in my heart,

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.799
Even the ones that look like keys.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.840
I will travel around the world

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.000
And this for many years.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My face is iconic, it's clear

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.160
They’ll never replace me

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.439
Pokémon, catch them, it's our story

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.640
I’m sure my father will see. Pokémon

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.160
Nothing will stop us, even if I lose every tournament

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
Pokémon, catch them

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.559
Even at our age

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.360
This franchise is sinking

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.939
This song is an outrage. Pokémon

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.879
Catch them all (x2)
